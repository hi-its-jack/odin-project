    <h3>Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbits</h3>
    <p>While the origins of this recipe are fantastical, this main course wouldn't be out of place at a Sunday night dinner. The root vegetables and woodsy herb flavors are perfect for a fall night.</p>
    <p>I did take a couple of liberties - since it is indeed the time of year here, I included the turnips, carrots and "taters" that Sam longed for. I also assumed that the hobbits might be carrying a few cooking supplies, like cooking oil, salt, pepper, and - perhaps most optimistically - chicken bouillon cubes. Finally, I thickened the stew with flour. Wandering hobbits would have had access to lembas bread, however I had to make do with what I had.</p>
    <p>Rabbit looks similar to chicken thighs, but the flavor is richer and gamier and the texture is a little more stringy. Still, skinless bone-in chicken thighs make a good substitute for the rabbit in this recipe.</p>

            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>5 sprigs thyme, woody stems removed, minced finely</li>
            <li>25-30 sage leaves</li>
            <li>1-2 small turnips</li>
            <li>2 carrots</li>
            <li>1-2 red potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 tbsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 portion finely crumbled lembas, or 3 tbsp flour</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the giblets from the rabbit and mince very finely, then set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut up the rabbit with a sharp knife. Remove the forelegs, which are not attached to the body by bone. Remove the hindlegs at the pelvis joint by first snapping the ball-and-socket joint backwards. Chop along the spine to separate the two halves of the rib cage, then chop each side into thirds.</li>
            <li>Peel the carrots and slice into half-inch rounds. Peel the potatoes and turnips and chop into half-inch chunks.</li>
            <li>In a dutch oven, heat the cooking oil over medium-high heat. Working 3-4 pieces at a time, brown both sides of each rabbit piece and set aside.</li>
            <li>Brown the carrot, turnip and potato in the remaining oil. Don't stir too much - you want to form a golden crust.</li>
            <li>Bring the heat down to medium, then sprinkle the flour over the vegetables. Toss well to mix the flour and residual oil together. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the flour turns a dark blonde color.</li>
            <li>Pour in 1 cup of the chicken broth, and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen the flavorful brown fond.</li>
            <li>Stir in the thyme, sage, bay leaves and pepper, then return the rabbit to the pot. Top up with additional chicken stock until everything is covered.</li>
            <li>Bring the stew to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Cover and cook for 60-90 minutes, or until the meat is tender. Stir in the finely minced giblets and cook for 2 -3 minutes more. Taste for salt and fish out the bay leaves before serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! (note: it goes perfect with a bottle of Old Winyards)</li>
