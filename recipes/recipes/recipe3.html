        <h1>Davos Delight</h1>
        <p>You can't enjoy the previous sumptuous meals without a refreshing drink to wash it all down with!</p>

        <p>This is why we are offering a refreshing glass of Davos' Delight.        
        It may just look like a glass of good old regular tap water...but wait.
        This is in fact a glass of proletariat tears fresh from the eyes of an underpaid migrant worker. 
         You're welcome. And enjoy.</p>
