        <p>I mean...just look at it. What could be more delicious than this wholesome block of soy.
        The great thing about this is that not only does it look great, it also requires almost no preparation.
        All you need to do is buy it, unwrap and then put it on a plate that you rented (remember...you won't own it 
        and you will be happy about that).
        Once you have done placed it on the plate, you can serve it and enjoy it along with Bill's Bug Bonanza</p>
        <p>Enjoy, Comrade!</p>
