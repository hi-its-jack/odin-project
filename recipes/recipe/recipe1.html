        <h1>Bill's Bug Bonanza</h1>
        <p>This appetising meal is courtesy of our good - and not at all malevolent - friend, Bill. </p>

        <p>Bill is a <em>hell</em> of a guy (take that how you will). He would never do anything to jeopardise the health and well being of the billions of people.
        <br>
        You can ignore any of the pernicious rumours you have heard about him from those crazy conspiracy theorists. What's more, Bill can't be bad <br>
        because he is the founder of a Tech Giant and has made gazillions of dollars. Plus, who ever heard anything bad about those kinda guys...
        </p> 
        <p>With all that being said, you are probably excited to learn how to conjure this delicious meal. Well, Bill actually learned how to make this dish
        <br>
        from his good friend Jeffrey while holidaying on his private island. Sadly, Jeffrey wrote the instructions on a secret list and that list has mysteriously
        <br>
        disappeared - along with Jeffrey.
