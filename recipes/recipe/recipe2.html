        <p>I mean...just look at it. What could be more delicioys than this wholesome block of soy.</p>
        <p>The great thing about this is that not only does it look great, it also requires almost no preparation.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is buy it, unwrap and then put it on a plate that you rented (remember...you won't own it <br>
        and you will be happy about that).</p>
        <p>Once you have done placed it on the plate, you can serve it and enjoy it along with Bill's Bug Bonanza</p>
        <p>Enjoy, Comrade!</p>
